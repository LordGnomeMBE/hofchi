    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my small site which holds the current PDF of my proposals for the former House of Fraser in Chichester. I hope you enjoy them, and think they are better than the Brochure proposals, which are ugly and do not fit the character of Chichester.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center">Postscript to my letter</h1>
    <article class="browser">
    <p>Since writing my letter, a couple of other interesting properties have come to my attention. These are two such in Trowbridge, Wiltshire: <a href="https://lordgnomembe.github.io/hofchi/forestreettrowbridge">a former bank on Fore Street</a> and <a href="https://lordgnomembe.github.io/hofchi/innoxmillstrowbridge">a large patch of development land</a>, both in the town centre. These both have excellent potential and I've prepared some brief notes on each, avaliable at the links above.</br></br> I also mentioned establishing a brewery - the easiest way to do this would be rather to purchase for £3,500,000 <a href="https://www.daltonsbusiness.com/listing/specialist-brewery-for-sale-DB1548035/">this brewery currently for sale</a> in the North East of England - the barrels could be delivered down to the South by boat or somesuch arrangement. The Brewery for sale was established in 1826, so is suitably historic for me! Rather than immediate establishment in Reading of a brewery, it could be used distribute this northern beer to the southern pubs I would have aquired. In time it could become a separate brewery for Southern England. I could also purchase <a href="https://business-asset.com/gb/index.php?page=business&item=-8544">this Cidery currently for sale</a>, to supply Cider to each pub.
    </br></br><p>I have thought more about how the Estate pubs, saved from closure, could become as an overall Estate, fairly self sufficient. I've already gone into some detail about how the pubs would have beer delivered from smallish Estate Brewers, and Cider from an Estate Cidery. As well as this, I was thinking that each pub that had the space could start its own microbrewery, so that each one had a House Special to make that pub interesting and different to the others. </br></br>On the subject of soft drinks, I was looking at some properties for sale in Tuscany - ancient mediaeval places at risk of being redeveloped into dreadful hotels. If these could be purchased, rather than simply being holiday perks for the Estate employees, they could grow oranges, lemons etc., bottled to sell in the pubs and hotels in England. There would be room for it in these places, and it would extend the impact of the Estate further, providing employment in depressed parts of italy and ensuring that these agricultural places remain that way. </br></br>The two properties in question are fairly close together in Tuscany, so could me managed by a Master of the Tuscan Estates as a pair. The first in Castiglion Ghinibaldi (see sales listing <a href="https://www.knightfrank.com/properties/residential/for-sale/monteriggioni-siena-tuscany/flo160033">here</a>) for €1,500,000 (about £1,300,000). It is an abandoned but still fairly sound castle with a fair amount of land that could be used for growing citrus trees. The second is the vastly more expensive Castello di Montingegnoli (see sales listing <a href="https://www.immobiliareitaliano.com/property/tuscan-castle-estate/">here</a> and <a href="https://search.savills.com/property-detail/gbsumbumb230007">here</a>) for €20,000,000 (about £17,000,000; price shown on the second listing only). It consists of an ancient hamlet, now abandoned, an a vast quantity of land, for which the same could be done. I would, with the latter, buy the church too. I know it adds another massive expense to an already large request, but it would make the Estate self-sufficient for another aspect. Each would be restored, and have locals employed to work the Estate, allowing the village to be lived in once again.</br></br>The high price reflects the fact that the seller is advertising it as a hotel opportunity. As I said, I am wary of asking for even more, but I truly believe that this could be an excellent opportunity to improve the lives of people, not just in the UK.</p>
