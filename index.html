    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my small site which holds the current PDF of my proposals for the former House of Fraser in Chichester. I hope you enjoy them, and think they are better than the Brochure proposals, which are ugly and do not fit the character of Chichester.</p>

    <h2>Further Ideas</h2>
    <p>Since writing my letter, a couple of other interesting properties have come to my attention. These are two such in Trowbridge, Wiltshire: <a href="https://lordgnomembe.github.io/hofchi/forestreettrowbridge">a former bank on Fore Street</a> and <a href="https://lordgnomembe.github.io/hofchi/innoxmillstrowbridge">a large patch of development land</a>, both in the town centre. These both have excellent potential and I've prepared some brief notes on each, avaliable at the links above.</br></br> I also mentioned establishing a brewery - the easiest way to do this would be rather to purchase for £3,500,000 <a href="https://www.daltonsbusiness.com/listing/specialist-brewery-for-sale-DB1548035/">this brewery currently for sale</a> in the North East of England - the barrels could be delivered down to the South by boat or somesuch arrangement. The Brewery for sale was established in 1826, so is suitably historic for me! Rather than immediate establishment in Reading of a brewery, it could be used as a Southern Distribution centre for the southern pubs I would have aquired. In time it could become a separate brewery for Southern England. I could also purchase <a href="https://business-asset.com/gb/index.php?page=business&item=-8544">this Cidery currently for sale<a/>, to supply Cider to each pub. Perhaps I could get the Italian property I mentioned growing oranges and lemons for the production of soft drinks, as well as the existing vineyard for wine production, as such (in the long term):</p>

<table style="width:70%">
  <tr>
    <th>Company or Place</th>
    <th>Area Served</th> 
    <th>Details</th>
    <th>Purchase Cost</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brewery currently for sale nr. Durham (see above)</td>
    <td>Northern England</td>
    <td>This brewery would, insofar as it is possible, get its ingredients from a farm or farms in the north of England (which would, longterm, be purchased) and supply drink to the pubs saved in Northern England.</td>
    <td>£3,500,000 for the Brewery itself (see above).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Woodhams & Co. Ltd., re-established at the old Gas Works in Reading (if possible)</td>
    <td>Southern England</td>
    <td>This brewery would be founded after I had gained some experience in the running of the northern brewery. It would get its ingredients from farm(s) purchased for the purpose in Southern England, and supply drinks to pubs saved in the South of England.</td>
    <td>Unknown at this point (£1,000,000 for the Reading site).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Apple Juice And Cidery currently for sale in Cornwall (see above)</td>
    <td>National</td>
    <td>This Apple Juice producer and Cidery would, long term, be transferred to somewhere historic in the South West of England - perhaps part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonedale_Mills">Tonedale Mills</a> or a smaller historic site, as and when such a place comes up for sale. It would produce apple and pear juice, as well as Cider, for the pubs across the country. Perhaps the businees linked to above (which is for sale) could be merged with <a href="rightmove.co.uk/properties/138273710">this one</a> to create a larger company. It would be supplied by orchards at Waterhayes Farm (ensuring the farm's commercial viability) and other similar sites.</td>
    <td>£135,000 purchase costs (not including property).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Castiglion Ghinibaldi (castle I mentioned in my letter, which is in Italy)</td>
    <td>National (UK)</td>
    <td>Once repaired, this ancient castle could be returned to use as a producer of wine, and potentially oranges and lemons too. Orange juice, lemon juice and wine could be produced for shipping to England - the latter for further processing into soft drinks. Perhaps the french property I briefly talked about could also produce wine.</td>
    <td>€1,500,000 for the site purchase cost.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Perhaps in the long run, if enough pubs were aquired in Scotland, a separate brewery could be established to supply them. With the above model of production (which I didn't go into much detail in my letter, but have since thought about a bit more), almost everything would be made in-house and so in theory for not a great deal more, the pubs could be supplied with far better, tracable products. I would encourage each pub, if there was the space, to have their own micro-brewery, so that different house specials could be found around the country.
